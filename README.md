# infra-tools
Testing area for various tooling code.

Go programs to setup infrastructure and connect to remote systems, including vSphere and ScaleIO hosts at present. 

Mainly an exercise to learn Go more fully but also to allow some useful functions that were missing from VMware's GoLang bindings, such as the rarely-implemented OVA upload functions which normally require the closed-source OVFTOOL program.
